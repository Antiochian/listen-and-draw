# listen-and-draw

An interactive widget where a user is invited to draw how they feel on a scrolling canvas while an experimental sound art track plays in the background.

This collaborative project is still under development - in particular, the sound art piece is not finished and a placeholder music track is being used instead. If you want to play the in-development version for yourself, you need to place a MP3 file called "test.mp3" inside the empty "\audio" folder.
